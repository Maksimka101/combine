  /// [entryPoint] is a function which will be called in Isolate.

  /// Also it may use closure variables but with some restrictions:
  ///  - closure variable will be copied (as every variable passed to isolate)
  ///    so it won't be synchronized across Isolates.
  ///  - if you use at least one variable from closure all closure variables
  ///    will be copied to the Isolate due to this
  ///    [issue](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/36983).
  ///    It can lead to high memory consumption or event exception because
  ///    some variables may contains native resources.
  ///
  /// Due to above points, I highly recommend you to avoid using closure
  /// variables, until this issue is fixed.

  /// ```dart
  /// CombineInfo isolateInfo = await Combine().spawn((context) {
  ///   print("Argument from main isolate: ${context.argument}");
  ///
  ///   context.messenger.messages.listen((message) {
  ///     print("Message from main isolate: $message");

  ///   ..messages.listen((message) {
  ///     print("Message from isolate: $message");

  ///   ..send("Hello from main isolate!");
  ///
  /// // Will print:
  /// // Argument from main isolate: 42
  /// // Message from main isolate: Hello from main isolate!
